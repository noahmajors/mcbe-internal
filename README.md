###  Minecraft Bedrock Edition Internal Cheat

`Features full array of cheats available in game, much similar to Horion, but with some additional features and revisions.`

`removed annoying horion watermark and title menu change`

`added streamer mode, which hides the cheat to your stream`

### STEPS
[1] Disable Windows Defender and other Antiviruses. (AV flags the cheat because it modifies files)

[2] Download and unzip the folder into any directory.

[3] Launch "minecraft-internal.exe" on the Minecraft main menu.

[4] Join a world/server, then press Ins to open the menu.

Although this cheat is undetected, I would advise either using an alt account or using discrete hacks.
